        <h4>Data and questions</h4>
        <p>This visualisation is based on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales/data">Video Game Sales dataset</a> produced by user <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut">GregorySmith</a> for the open data website Kaggle. This dataset was created by scraping sales data from VGChartz.com (in millions of units) for around 16,000 videogames. I have cut this down to the top 100 games for the sake of providing a concise but meaningful dataset that can be represented at a highly granular level. My final dataset contains 100 records (data points) comprising 11 attributes each.</p>
        <p>The data's key attributes are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Name of game (categorical)</li>
					<li>VGchartz rank (based on total global sales) (ordinal)</li>
					<li>Publisher (categorical)</li>
					<li>Genre (categorical)</li>
					<li>Year of release (ordinal)</li>
					<li>Global sales (in terms of millions of units sold) (ordinal)</li>
					<li>North American sales (in terms of millions of units sold) (ordinal)</li>
					<li>European sales (in terms of millions of units sold) (ordinal)</li>
					<li>Japanese sales (in terms of millions of units sold) (ordinal)</li>
					<li>Rest of world sales (in terms of millions of units sold) (ordinal)</li>
				</ul>
        <p>This raises a range of specific and broader questions about these best-selling games, including:</p>
				<p>Specific:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Which publishers can be considered most and least successful in terms of producing the most successful games?</li>
					<li>What genres of games are the most popular?</li>
					<li>Which systems do the most successful games appear on?</li>
					<li>What years produced the highest and lowest volumes of all-time best-sellers?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>More open-ended</p>
					<ul>
					<li>What does this dataset tell us about the preferences of different regions with regard to videogames?</li>
					<li>Are there any obvious time-based trends in the data?</li>
					</ul>
				<p>This dataset and the questions it raises could have a number of potential usage scenarios. While they are potentially interesting to videogame historians and writers who may wish to comment on the state of the market in different places and times, videogame publishers and developers may be able to discern trends from it that would have commercial uses. For example, they may be able to determine whether they should focus on making games in a particular genre, or for which system, and in what countries they could expect to sell better or worse in, allowing them to focus development efforts, game distribution, and regional marketing budgets more effectively.</p>

				<h4>Description of visualisation</h4>
				<p>I represented this dataset using bar charts with interactive features to filter channels by attribute or to provide data on demand.</p>

				<p>My visualisation comprises different views of the data, split into: overviews of the whole dataset (see links under the (“Overviews of Top 100 by:” heading) by game (see the first All Games tab) or aggregated breakdowns of representation of a particular attribute on the top 100 filtered (the top row publisher, genre, system, and year links), and; regional breakdowns of the above (all links under the Top 100 by unit sales (with regional filters) heading). Consequently the visualisation/s is/are as follows (in order of links):<p>

				<ul>
				<li>(a)	All top 100 best-selling games by units sold.</li>
				<li>(b)	Overview: Number of games in the top 100 by publisher</li>
				<li>(c)	Overview: Number of games in the top 100 by genre</li>
				<li>(d)	Overview: Number of games in the top 100 by system</li>
				<li>(e)	Overview: Number of games in the top 100 by year</li>
				<br/>

				<li>(f)	Sales (in units) of all top 100 games</li>
				<li>(g)	Sales (in units) of the top 100 games by publisher</li>
				<li>(h)	Sales (in units) of the top 100 games by genre</li>
				<li>(i)	Sales (in units) of the top 100 games by system</li>
				<li>(j)	Sales (in units) of the top 100 games by year</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The first row of links (“Overview of Top 100 by:”) shows the top 100 as broader overviews of the data:</p>

				<p>Chart (a) is a standard bar chart which displays each game in the list as a single bar with a length magnitude channel representing total its global sales. Schneiderman (1996, p339) would refer to this as an overview. </p>

				<p>Chart (a) offers tooltips which display details about each game, (name, publisher, etc); Schneiderman (1996, p340) calls this providing “Data On Demand”).<p>

				<p> The pink text directly above the chart enables the user to change the mapping of the colour hue channel to represent genres, publishers, or systems. </p>

				<p> The user can therefore identify trends through particularly common colours. This is not strictly a filter under Schneiderman’s definitions as it does not remove unnecessary data (1996, 339)), rather it displays relationships between items in the set, making it more akin to what he calls the “relate” function (1996, p340).</p>

				<p>However, it is not always easy to read colour hue trends due to the volume of games in chart (a) as the horizontal positioning channel of the chart interferes with reading colour trends, so the links to views, (b), (c), (d), and (e) can be considered interactive elements of view (a), relating the data by aggregating how many games of a given attribute value are in the top 100 (i.e. chart (b) shows how many top 100 games are by each publisher, etc). </p>

				<p>For each of these charts, the length channel represents the number of games in the top 100 pertaining to that attribute value, and the colour channel helps the user differentiate between bars (as does the text below each bar). In terms of interactivity, each of these offers data on demand of the aggregated breakdown of the top 100 by that attribute value, including aggregated regional and global sales for games with that value (i.e. each bar on chart (b) has a tooltip displaying how many games from a particular publisher are in the top 100, as well as global and regional sales for all games by that publisher). This allows the user to more easily determine the trends highlighted by the colour channel in chart (a). One key limitation here is that the user cannot see what games the current grouping refers to as they can on chart (a).</p>

				<p>The second row of links (Top 100 by unit sales (with regional filters) – tables (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j)) is similar to the above, but focuses on game sales by units, with the option to filter each chart by region.<p>

				<p>Chart (f) (All games, bottom row) is (as with chart (a)) a standard bar chart in which each bar represents a single game in the top 100. It also has interactive tooltips which display data on demand about each game, including its name, publisher, year of release, genre, and sales in all regions, and filters (this time actually filters in the sense referred to by Schneiderman) which display sales of each game by region. The length channel once again represents the total global sales of each game in the top 100, and here the pink button text above the chart enables the user to change the mapping of the length channel such that bars represent each game’s sales globally or by individual region (cutting out unnecessary data points, making this the sort of filter referred to by Schneiderman (1996, p339)). This enables users to compare sales of particular games by region. </p>

				<p>The links to charts (g), (h), (i), and (j) can be considered interactive elements of chart (a), as these focus on the sales of games by each attribute value (i.e. chart (f) shows sales for game by each publisher etc). For each of these charts, the length magnitude channel of the bars represents the unit sales of all games pertaining to a given attribute value, and the colour hue channel helps the user differentiate between bars more easily (as is the text below each bar).</p>

				<p>Once again in terms of interactivity, each of these offers a tooltip to provide more specific information on the breakdown of the top 100 by that particular attribute value, including combined regional and global sales for all relevant games (i.e. each bar on chart (g) has a tooltip displaying the sales of all games from a particular publisher by region, allowing the user to compare the numbers), and allows users to filter the data by regional sales using the pink buttons to augment the bars’ length accordingly. This allows the users to any clear differences in sales of games of different attributes between and within regions.</p>

				<p>To ensure that the user always knows what they are looking at, yellow highlights are used to separate key information where the user current is and what they are looking at from information about other possible selections and filters that are not relevant to the view at hand.</p>

				<h4>Implementation</h4>
				<p>As evidenced by my ideation process, although I had considered some ideas including maps and clustered circles representing data, my thinking on displaying this data focused on bar charts, which I consider to be a very effective and intuitive way to display information for comparison, as they can make good use of the length and colour hue channels that Munzner considers particularly effective for ordinal and categorical data respectively (Munzner, p94). </p>

				<p>Most of the charts essentially are based on the same code, amended to build the bars and axes by different data attributes, which I developed largely based on the tutorial examples provided by Uta Hinrichs. In particular, the Basic Visualisation (Hinrichs, 2018a) and Scale and Axes (Hinrichs, 2018b) tutorials proved very important for grasping how to make bar charts and alter properties in them.</p>

				<p>However, my data and intended use of it was somewhat more complex than the data used in the standard examples. In particular, I needed to get aggregated figures of numbers of games by category and sales figures to control the length attributes of charts (b)-(e) and (g)-(j) respectively. Consequently I implemented nested data and rollups to sum up sales figures by the relevant attributes used as keys for the nests. For nesting data and performing rollups to get aggregate values, I adapted some code snippets from the Bocoup Data Visualisation Team’s <a href=”http://learnjsdata.com/group_data.html“>guide to grouping data</a>, and for sorting, I adapted a snippet from Stackoverflow user Nisfan’s <a href=”https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30480981/d3-js-sorting-by-rollup-field”>response to a query about sorting in d3</a>.</p>

				<p>I also needed to convert the data to integers as many of the values were initially read by d3.js as strings rather than integers, creating a number of NaN errors when trying to build the charts. This was solved by adapting code from Stackoverflow Adam Pearce’s <a href=”https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17601105/how-do-i-convert-strings-from-csv-in-d3-js-and-be-able-to-use-them-as-a-dataset?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa”>response to an existing query</a> on this issue.</p>

				<p>(Please note that full cited references are provided below).</p>

				<p>Once I had a reasonable understanding of how to build a single bar chart and modify its properties and axes from the tutorial work, I was able to extrapolate to base these on these aggregated properties, and was able to do so for a number of combinations of variables. While I would have liked to be able to make this dynamic, I had trouble finding information on how to switch between datasets where these sets were not contained in separate csv files, and so accepted that for the basic “filters” by genre, publisher, and year, I would have to simply make separate pages linked by hyperlinks instead. However, using some understanding of Javascript and JQuery, I was able to figure out to alter properties of the bars such as length and colour using “if/else if” statements contained within the d3 code to build the bars, enabling me to create some dynamic functionality, if not completely using pure d3 functionality</p>.

				<p>In terms of limitations, as noted, I had considered how to get more attributed onto the bar chart during my ideation process. Such further attributes could be mapped to positioning on a common scale on the x or y axis in grouped or stacked bar charts, allowing for a deeper breakdown and direct comparison. For example, I would have liked for charts (b)-(e) and (g)-(j) to be stacked bar charts where each segment represented a further categorical attribute (and its length a fraction of the overall ordinal attribute being measured), allowing for the primary filter to be broken down by a secondary filter (i.e. a chart showing bars of overall sales by publisher broken down by genre or regional sales). Unfortunately the structure of my data complicated this, as I was unable to determine how to access the properties of double-nested data. Consequently the scope of the visualisations were somewhat less than I would have liked, requiring me to make a larger number of charts which each showed fewer attributes. </p>


				<h4>Insights</h4>
				<p>This visualisation answers many specific and broader questions about this data.</p>
				<p>Specific questions about the most successful publishers, genres, systems, and years of publication (in terms of entries/representation in the top 100) can be answered by the relevant links in the “Overviews of top 100 by:” row (top row). </p>

				<p>The main overview (view (a)) provides some broad insights into these questions. The pink colour filter/relation buttons above the chart show trends based on the above attributes (except for year). The publisher filter/relation reveals a clear trend towards cornflower-blue, which the tooltip reveals to be Nintendo. Similarly, the genre filter/relation that shooters (red) are quite popular, with a few  blocks of red bars. The system filter does shows few clear groupings of any colour, and here the horizontal positioning channel interfere with the user’s ability to determine such trends from spotting matching colours. This issue could be resolved by making the chart reshuffle the bars to group them by colour, making this view less useful; however, the following overview links reveal trends at a high level more clearly.</p>

				<p>Switching between the top row of links we can confirm that Nintendo takes up over half of the top 100. (click the Publisher button in the top row)</p>
				<p>Similarly, the top row Genre button reveals that the Shooter genre comprises over a fifth of the top 100<p>
				<p>The top row System button reveals a more even distribution of games on the top 100 by System, with the Xbox 360, Wii, and DS having higher values clustered closely together.</p>
				<p>The top row year filter button shows that 2010 was responsible for the most top-ranked games, though only by a small margin. p>

				<p>Turning to the broader questions, we can look at the second row of buttons to see the above data questions considered in terms of units sold rather than representation in the top 100, and broken down by region.<p>

				<p>Clicking through the second row attribute buttons, shows that, Nintendo remains the top publisher in terms of global unit sales of top 100 games, that shooters remain the most popular genre but only marginally (losing ground to platformers),  and that Wii and DS game unit sales outweigh the Xbox360, even if the latter is responsible for more top 100 games. </p>

				<p>These second row charts can show sales filtered by region via the pink buttons above the charts. Filtering the second row Genre chart by region reveals that while shooters may be the most popular genre globally in terms of unit sales, this is buoyed by a significant prevalence of the genre in the North American market, where its sales significantly eclipses those of most other genres in the top 100. This distribution is less skewed in the EU, with sales of top 100 games more evenly distributed across genres, and with sports titles roughly equalling shooters’ popularity. Japan stands out here, with platformers and role-playing games selling around 10 and 15 times as many units as shooters respectively (calculated from the specific figures in the tooltips).</p>

				<p>Similarly, games made for different systems (second row System button) also sell significantly differently by region. Looking at regional sales by units, we can see that the Wii shifted most units of top 100 games by a significant margin, and that Japan makes very few Xbox360 game sales (tooltip data allows us to calculate this as less than 1% of global sales). Looking at the next two systems with the highest top 100 list representation, we can see that Japan comprises a higher percentage of sales for games on these systems (10% of units sold globally for top 100 Wii games, and around 25% for top 100-ranked DS games.</p>

				<p>Considering the aforementioned use cases, this suggests that many publishers may want to consider how they target the Japanese market.</p>

				<p>Regarding temporal trends, the Year chart in the top row shows a relatively visible inverse relationship (up to a point) between how long ago a game was made and whether it ranks on the top 100; perhaps games are improving as technology advances. However, technological progress is not the only determinant of game popularity, as years after 2010 show diminishing numbers of top 100 games, while some outliers can be seen preceding 2010 (notably 1996-1997 and 2004-2005), suggesting that more games of quality were produced during these periods. We see a similar trend between sales and year of release on the second row year button, perhaps attributable to a long-term growth in the market for videogames.</p>

				<p>In terms of limitations of the design of this visualisation, I recognise that the sheer volumes of options for different types of filters leads to a lot of information above the chart for the user to take in and may impact ease of use, and have attempted to resolve this by ensuring that users can simply look at the yellow header text and highlighted links to clearly understand what chart and filter is active. Being able to reshuffle the All Games chart (chart (a)) as well recolour it would perhaps eliminate the need for the other charts in that row, simplifying the overall design. It would also have been good to see what games comprise each bar of the aggregated trend charts (top row), but I was unable to do so. Additionally, as noted, implementing stacked or grouped bar charts could enable more easily comparable regional data in the bottom row charts, or break the top charts down by other attributes.</p>

				<p>Additionally, to fit the subject matter, the visualisation is styled around the visuals of classic videogames. I debated whether the bright colours on black impacted readability, but a few test users did not take issue with it.<p>
