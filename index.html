          <p>I am presently seeking employment as a web or software developer, having recently finished studying for an MSc in Computing and IT at the University of St Andrews. This degree has given me experience in a range of technologies including HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Foundation, Javascript and jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, CouchDB, mySQL, and Tableau.</p>
            <p>I have a background predominantly focused on financial services regulation, having spent much of my career at the Bank of England Prudential Regulation Authority; however, after taking some online coding courses as a hobby, I decided to return to university so that I could devote myself full-time to making a move into a technology-driven career.
