            <h4>Boat Tour</h4>
            <p>
                Boat trips include Murano. It is believed that glassmaking in Murano originated in 9th century Rome, with significant Asian influences, as Venice was a major trading port. Muranos reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire and destruction of the city's mostly wooden buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano glass is still interwoven with Venetian glass.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also a trip to Burano. The ancient art of lace-making has been passed down from generation to generation through the skilled hands of the Burano lace-makers, right up to the present day.

                            My husband and I were very impressed with this tour and the one we took in Madrid. The guides were very knowledgeable and friendly. Both tours were well organized and the fee was very reasonable. I will definitely use them again and tell all my friends to use them for their tours.

                            The tour was really well arranged and showed us both history and sights that we would never have found. The trip down the grand canal was fantastic with the sun setting towards the end of the journey.  Definitely money well spent.We could do it all again tomorrow.

                            Great local (english-speaking) tour guides who really know the city's history and architecture.  Very informative and enjoyable. St. Marks Basilica tour was very short, as only the central cathedral was visited. If you expect a more detailed tour of St. Mark's, I suggest you find a different tour. However, as a overall tour of Venice, especially for 1st time visitors, Venice in One Day tour, both walking and grand canal boat tour, is a great value and truly helps you understand the history and special culture of Venice.

                            We decided on this company after on a friend’s recommendation. We loved every minute if our Venice holiday and the walking tour guide was excellent. We would suggest taking water even in October and remember to take sensible walking shoes. The trip on the canal was breathtaking. Lots of photo opportunities. The breaks allowed us to peruse the shops and sample the amazing food on offer.

                            My parents and I enjoyed all our tours. The walking tour was very informative and we would never have had enough time to venture back into some of the small canals without a guide. This tour gave us the opportunity to see so much more than we would have on our own! During our breaks we had plenty of time for lunch & some shopping. The boat tour was on a beautiful wood water taxi and our guide was very friendly and informative as well. I will recommend this tour to all my friends and family!
